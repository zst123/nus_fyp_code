Conduct a noise sensitivity analysis on the crossbar using Monte Carlo.

Generates plots of probability distribution frequency and calculates the the sample mean and standard deviation for different crossbar array sizes.

Run `bash simulate.sh`. Modify accordingly to specify the Monte Carlo gaussian distribution which will be applied on the memristor cell (this simulates the manufacturing tolerance)
